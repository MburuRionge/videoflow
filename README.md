# videoflo
Videoflo is series of Python scripts to help automate your YouTube video production workflow in DaVinci Resolve.

Not only will Videoflo eliminate many mundane aspects of video production, but it will also keep your projects organized throughout the entire process from the inception of an idea to a published upload.

For a complete tutorial on how to install and use Videoflo, go to [videoflo.app](https://videoflo.app).

# UPDATE 2022-08-06
My YouTube Data API quota of 150,000 queries per day was reached in just a couple hours due to an abusive user of videoflo. For this reason, I have removed videoflo from production. Uploading to YouTube will no longer work. Other features of videoflo will still work just fine. Sorry for the inconvenience.
